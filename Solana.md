# Solana
Solana is a high-performance blockchain supporting builders around the world creating crypto apps that scale today. Solana is a
decentralized blockchain built to enable scalable, user-friendly apps, Solana can process more transactions and charges much lower
gass fees then Ethereum. With Solana you can write smart contracts with ease and it is possible to trade in NFTS.
Solana is a proof-of-stake (POS) blockchain and also uses a new technology called Proof of History (Pol).

# What is Proof of History?

> This time problem gets pretty difficult in distributed systems. When you need to move fast and process transactions as soon as
possible, you need to be able to time in small units. But many programmable blockchains, like Ethereum, rely on outside
programs to assign a "median" timestamp â€“ which they then use to validate transactions in the order they were received.
> But referring back to a centralized source defeats the purpose of a decentralized system. Solana solves this problem by using an
innovative technology called Proof of History, which allows these "timestamps" to be built into the blockchain itself.
# Performance and fees
* Solana transaction fees are averaging $0.00025 per transaction.
* Solana can process 65,000 transactions per second.

# Is Solana scalable?
Solana ensures composability between ecosystem projects by maintaining a single global state as the network scales. Never deal with
fragmented Layer 2 systems or sharded chains.

According to (Rodrigues, 2021):

> Solana is a highly scalable decentralized blockchain developed with a unique method of ordering transactions that significantly
improves its transaction throughput, to the point that it has consistently been processing over 2,500 transactions per second. It
claims to be able to process 50,000 transactions per second.

# Community
Solana has a community distributed over multiple platforms for example Twitter and Discord.


# Development
Solana enables developing in Rust. According to a survey conducted by Stack Overflow, Rust was voted for the top position by
developers for four consecutive years.

# Pros and cons
According to (Sanyal, 2021):

## Pros
* Fast transactions and low fees
    > Solana is Ethereum's biggest rival. ETH can currently process 14 transactions per second (TPS), whereas SOL can support
50,000 TPS.
* Solana has the third-largest futures market
* NFTs and smart contracts
## Cons
* Solana is not decentralized enough
    > The ETH network has over 200,000 validators, but the Solana network only has 1,000 validators to date. The more the number of validators, the more secure the network
* Unstable network
    > With a shorter track record than Ethereum, investors may not be easily convinced to buy SOL over Ethereum. The crypto's reputation took a hit when the Solana Foundation tweeted that its network is experiencing some instability.
* Solana's testing phases
    > Solana has big plans for the future, but many of those plans still remain in beta testing.
# Conclusion
Solana is an impressive cryptocurrency. With thousands of cryptocurrencies in the market, it stands apart by showing consistent
growth and potential. Solana has very low gas fees an an incredible transaction speed. Solana's main problem is that it is not
decentralized enough with currently 1500+ validators while DeFi being a big importance in the crypto industry. With Solana launching
in March 2020 it is a very young project and it might not work out.
