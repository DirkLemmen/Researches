Jovi Simons

Jovi has viewed the menu page where customers land on. This page is used for ordering dishes.

Feedback: "I think the menu has a really modern feeling. For me it is very clear what actions I can perform on the page." 

Jovi was very happy with the design. He thaught it looked modern and clear.
One thing I mentioned is that he didn't know the bar with categories is scrollable.
We discussed this and thaught an arrow should be an appropriate to let the user know it is scrollable.
