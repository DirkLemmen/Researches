# Agile methods

## What is Agile?
What Agile means according to (Atlassian, z.d.):
“Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.”

## Agile principles

According to (The 12 Agile Project Management Principles Explained, z.d.) this are the 12 Agile principles:
1.  Satisfy Customers Through Early & Continuous Delivery
2.  Welcome Changing Requirements Even Late in the Project
3.  Deliver Value Frequently
4.  Break the Silos of Your Project
5.  Build Projects Around Motivated Individuals
6.  The Most Effective Way of Communication is Face-to-face
7.  Working Software is the Primary Measure of Progress
8.  Maintain a Sustainable Working Pace
9.  Continuous Excellence Enhances Agility
10. Simplicity is Essential
11. Self-organizing Teams Generate Most Value
12. Regularly Reflect and Adjust Your Way of Work to Boost Effectiveness

## What are Agile methodologies?
Agile methodologies are different ways teams choose to follow Agile principles. The most popular methodology uses is Scrum.

### Different Agile methods
- Scrum

> Scrum is the most pupular framework. A team that uses this method is led by a Scrum Master. Scrum works in cycles of development called sprints, these sprints have a lenght varying between 1 and 4 weeks. Daily meetings where the team discusses tasks and obstacles.

- Extreme programming (XP)
> XP and Scrum share the most common concepts like: release planning, daily meetings, retrospective and other elements of the agile process. Aspects what makes XP different from scrum are: programming in pairs, code reviews and unit testing all code. With XP the team can easy handle requirement changes from the customers even when they are later in the development stage. One downside with XP is that the extreme focus on software developent can ensure some problems in other areas in development.

- Kanban

> The Kanban method exists in a board or table called a Kanban board, this board shows the flow of the production. 
> Deliverables are presented visually on a kanban board. This way the state of the process is visible for team members. This board shows every flow of the software development procedure. As the team proceeds further in the project the board changes.
> With this method it is easy to view the status of all tasks in the project. One problem is that there are no timeframes in Kanban, because of this you can come across time problems.


## Scrum explanation
Scrum is a framework that helps teams working together. Scrum learns teams to learn trough experience in the project. A team reflects on the positive and negative points and by doing this they continuously improve the process. Scrum focuses on small iterations and stories are determined in a sprint. 

### Daily scrum
Short stand-up meeting that takes place at the same time every day. In this meeting the team discusses tasks and obstacles.

### Sprint
A sprint is a cycle between 1 and 4 weeks in which work must be completed.

### Sprint review
In the sprint review you review the work that has been completed in the last sprint.

### Sprint retrospective
A sprint retrospective is held after the end of a sprint. In this meeting you reflect on the process and discuss the positive and negative. With this process you can improve the development.
