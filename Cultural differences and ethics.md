Cultural & Ethics

# Cultural

## What is culture?
According to (Pappas, 2021):
> Culture is the characteristics and knowledge of a particular group of people, encompassing language, religion, cuisine, social habits, music and arts.

> Culture is the way we behave trough basic concepts but have a different view on those concepts. Culture is inherited but also can be learned even if you aren't aware of it. You can have different feelings then other about what is good and what is bad.

## Which cultural aspects would you keep in mind when facing cultural differences? 
> Is it good to keep in mind that the norms & values can be very different. When you are going to visit another country you should try to understand and embrace the cultural differences.

> According to Hofdstede's theory this are the cultural aspects that create cultural differences:

## How can cultures be clustered?
> Over the world there are multiple cultural clusters and they all have different characteristics. According to (Characteristics of Clusters, z.d.) Characteristics include: 

> - Anglo - competitive and result-oriented
> - Confucian Asia - result-driven, encourage group working together over individual goals
> - Eastern Europe - forceful, supportive of co-workers, treat women with equality
> - Germanic Europe - value competition & aggressiveness and are more result-oriented
> - Latin America - loyal & devoted to their families and similar groups
> - Latin Europe - value individual autonomy
> - Middle East - devoted & loyal to their own people, women afforded less status
> - Nordic Europe - high priority on long-term success, women treated with greater equality
> - Southern Asia - strong family & deep concern for their communities
> - Sub-Sahara Africa - concerned & sensitive to others, demonstrate strong family loyalty

> Cultures are brought together in many different ways, one common way cultures are clustered together is in countries. Some countries bring together a lot of different cultures a so called multicultural society.

## Can you give examples for things going not as expected when interacting with people from other cultures? What and why went differently? 

- Gestures
  > Gestures that are normal in some cultures can be abnormal in other cultures like in Europa it is not very common to give tips to waiters, but in America leaving a tip under 15% can seem rude.

- Clothing

  > The way you dress are diffent in many cultures for example in countries like India, Africa and Muslim countries in the Middle East, it is not normal to dress provocatively. Covering the shoulders, chest and knees goes a long way.

## What is your culture? 
> I'm a person born in the Netherlands that goes in with the Dutch culture. I eat typical Dutch food and celebrate Dutch holidays. For me it is normal to work and Monday to Friday and spend free time at practising sports, hang on the couch or go out with friends.

## How would you act in the future when you know that you need to communicate or collaborate with a person from another culture?
> When I first meet a person I'm a bit holding back to figure out how the person is and learn to know him better. When I don't know how culture is put together I will ask the person how I can adapt. This way I can treat the other person with respect for his culture. 

## What did you do to improve the group communications with respect to cultural differences? 
> In our group we have one person that comes abroad. We adapted to this persons culture to speak in English when he is present. Also documentation files and messages in teams are in English so we can all understand each other. 

# High and Low context
Low context cultures are more focussed on achieving invidual success while high context cultures are more focussed on achieving success in a team. Below you can see the differences between high and low context cultures.

# Ethics

## What is ethics in software engineering?
According to (uio, 2021):

> Software engineering ethics can be approached from three directions. First, it can
describe the activity of software engineers making practical choices that affect other
people in significant ways. Second, it can be used to describe a collection of principles,
guidelines, or ethical imperatives that guide or legislative action, and third, it can be used
to name a discipline that studies the relationship between the other two senses of ethics.
Software engineering ethics is clearly both an activity and a body of principles. The
discipline of software engineering ethics that studies this activity and formalizes these
principles, however, is in its infancy.

## Why is ethics important in software engineering? 
> Ethics in software can help follow a professional behaviour in the workplace and online. Ethics are import to decide actions. It is important to follow ethics to prevent dilemmas and be proffesional. 

## What do you have to do as a software engineer to address ethical aspects in your work? 
> As a software engineer it is required to follow ethics to work in a professional manner. According to (ACM Ethics, 2018) software engineers should follow Eight Principles: 

> 1. PUBLIC – Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.

> 2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER – Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.

> 3. PRODUCT – Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.

> 4. JUDGMENT – Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.

> 5. MANAGEMENT – Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.

> 6. PROFESSION – Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.

> 7. COLLEAGUES – Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.

> 8. SELF – Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession. 

## How do you know that your ethical considerations match with those of other software engineers? 
> You should discuss each others view on ethics. This way you can confirm if your ethical considerations match, if they don't match then both have to adapt to each other and find a middle way. By doing this software engineers stay professional. 

## Which ethical aspects play a role in your project? 
> We act in a professional manner to our stakeholder and have him updated on the project.
> We speak up when we are stuck on something. By doing this we can help each other out and don't spend to much time on a problem.

## Can you do something to avoid or minimize these conflicts? 
> To minimize conflicts software engineers should discuss a topic till its clear for everyone to prevent misunderstanding. 
> Ask stakeholder and your colleagues feedback frequently
