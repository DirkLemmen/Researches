Cultural & Ethics

# Cultural

## What is culture?
According to (Pappas, 2021):
> Culture is the characteristics and knowledge of a particular group of people, encompassing language, religion, cuisine, social habits, music and arts.

## Which cultural aspects would you keep in mind when facing cultural differences? 
> Is it good to keep in mind that the norms & values can be very different. When you are going to visit another country you should try to understand and embrace the cultural differences.

## How can cultures be clustered?
> Cultures are brought together in many different ways, one common way cultures are clustered together is in countries. Some countries bring together a lot of different cultures a so called multicultural society.

## Can you give examples for things going not as expected when interacting with people from other cultures? What and why went differently? 

- Gestures
  > Gestures that are normal in some cultures can be abnormal in other cultures like in Europa it is not very common to give tips to waiters, but in America leaving a tip under 15% can seem rude.

- Clothing

  > The way you dress are diffent in many cultures for example in countries like India, Africa and Muslim countries in the Middle East, it is not normal to dress provocatively. Covering the shoulders, chest and knees goes a long way.

## What is your culture? 
> I'm a person born in the Netherlands that goes in with the Dutch culture. I eat typical Dutch food and celebrate Dutch holidays. For me it is normal to work and Monday to Friday and spend free time at practising sports, hang on the couch or go out with friends.

## How would you act in the future when you know that you need to communicate or collaborate with a person from another culture?
> When I first meet a person I'm a bit holding back to figure out how the person is and learn to know him better. When I don't know how culture is put together I will ask the person how I can adapt. This way I can treat the other person with respect for his culture. 

## What did you do to improve the group communications with respect to cultural differences? 
> In our group we have one person that comes abroad. We adapted to this persons culture to speak in English when he is present. Also documentation files and messages in teams are in English so we can all understand each other.
