# Business processes

## What is a business process? 
According to (Appian, z.d.): “A business process is a collection of linked tasks that find their end in the delivery of a service or product to a client.” It always contains a combined effort of multiple people to make value, so we split the group up in specializations according to their skillset. We do these series of activities in a sequence where we do our bit of work and then pass it on to the next person. We assign a member with the right skillset for a particular part of the work, we call this their role.


## Relation between business processes and software development
Business process can be automated by software. For example the business processes in a restaurant can be easily automated. Processes like ordering food and sending the order to the kitchen can be automated with software, this replaces the work from a waiter.  

## Process related to the project
In the group project we are building a software for a restaurant. This software automates the order process. With this automatization the process of ordering in the restaurant is more efficient, because there is less interaction with the waiter and orders are immediately send to the kitchen. 

This diagram visualizes the ordering process of the business before automatization:

## How does this effect people?
1. Customer

   > The customer can order whenever they want and don't have to wait for a waiter to take in the order.
3. Kitchen staff
   
   > Orders are shown on a digital page with an order status so it's easy to recognize what the state of a certain order is.
5. Waiter

   > The waiter has less interaction in the ordering process then before. The waiter doesn't have to take in orders anymore and now only has to serve the dishes.
